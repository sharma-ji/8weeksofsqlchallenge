# üçä Case Study #8 - Fresh Segments
<p align="center">
<img src="/IMG/org-8.png" width=40% height=40%>


## üõ†Ô∏è Problem Statement

> Danny created Fresh Segments, a digital marketing agency that helps other businesses analyse trends in online ad click behaviour for their unique customer base.

> Clients share their customer lists with the Fresh Segments team who then aggregate interest metrics and generate a single dataset worth of metrics for further analysis.

> In particular - the composition and rankings for different interests are provided for each client showing the proportion of their customer list who interacted with online assets related to each interest for each month.

> Danny has asked for your assistance to analyse aggregated metrics for an example client and provide some high level insights about the customer list and their interests.

## üìÇ Dataset
For this case study there is a total of 2 datasets which you will need to use to solve the questions.

### **```Interest Metrics```**

<details>
<summary>
View table
</summary>

This table contains information about aggregated interest metrics for a specific major client of Fresh Segments which makes up a large proportion of their customer base.

Each record in this table represents the performance of a specific ```interest_id``` based on the client‚Äôs customer base interest measured through clicks and interactions with specific targeted advertising content.

| _month | _year | month_year |	interest_id	| composition |	index_value	| ranking | percentile_ranking |
|--------|-------|------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|---------|--------------------|
| 7	     | 2018	 | 07-2018	  | 32486	    | 11.89	      | 6.19	    | 1	      | 99.86 |
| 7	     | 2018	 | 07-2018	  | 6106	    | 9.93	      | 5.31	    | 2	      | 99.73 |
| 7	     | 2018	 | 07-2018	  | 18923	    | 10.85	      | 5.29	    | 3	      | 99.59 |
| 7	     | 2018	 | 07-2018	  | 6344	    | 10.32	      | 5.1	        | 4 	  | 99.45 |
| 7	     | 2018	 | 07-2018	  | 100	        | 10.77	      | 5.04	    | 5	      | 99.31 |
| 7	     | 2018	 | 07-2018	  | 69	        | 10.82	      | 5.03	    | 6	      | 99.18 |
| 7	     | 2018	 | 07-2018	  | 79	        | 11.21	      | 4.97	    | 7	      | 99.04 |
| 7	     | 2018	 | 07-2018	  | 6111	    | 10.71	      | 4.83	    | 8	      | 98.9 |
| 7	     | 2018	 | 07-2018	  | 6214	    | 9.71	      | 4.83	    | 8	      | 98.9 |
| 7	     | 2018	 | 07-2018	  | 19422	    | 10.11	      | 4.81	    | 10	  | 98.63 |

For example - let‚Äôs interpret the first row of the ```interest_metrics``` table together:

| _month | _year | month_year | interest_id	| composition | index_value	| ranking | percentile_ranking | 
|--------|-------|------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|---------|--------------------|
| 7	2018 | 07-2018 | 32486 | 11.89 | 6.19 | 1 | 99.86 |


> In July 2018, the ```composition``` metric is 11.89, meaning that 11.89% of the client‚Äôs customer list interacted with the interest ```interest_id = 32486``` - we can link ```interest_id``` to a separate mapping table to find the segment name called ‚ÄúVacation Rental Accommodation Researchers‚Äù

The ```index_value``` is 6.19, means that the ```composition``` value is 6.19x the average composition value for all Fresh Segments clients‚Äô customer for this particular interest in the month of July 2018.

The ```ranking``` and ```percentage_ranking``` relates to the order of ```index_value``` records in each month year.

</details>

### **```Interest Map```**

<details>
<summary>
View table
</summary>

This mapping table links the ```interest_id``` with their relevant interest information. You will need to join this table onto the previous ```interest_details``` table to obtain the ```interest_name``` as well as any details about the summary information.

**Q1. Update the fresh_segments.interest_metrics table by modifying the month_year column to be a date data type with the start of the month**
```sql
ALTER TABLE fresh_segments.interest_metrics
ADD month_year2 DATE;

update fresh_segments.interest_metrics
set month_year2 = date_format(str_to_date(month_year, '%m-%Y'),'%Y-%m-01');
```


**Q2. What is count of records in the fresh_segments.interest_metrics for each month_year value sorted in chronological order (earliest to latest) with the null values appearing first?**
```sql
select month_year2, count(*) from fresh_segments.interest_metrics
group by month_year2
order by month_year2;
```

**Result:**
| month_year2 | count(*) |
|-------------|----------|
| null        | 1        |
| 2018-07-01  | 709      |
| 2018-08-01  | 752      |
| 2018-09-01  | 774      |
| 2018-10-01  | 853      |
| 2018-11-01  | 925      |
| 2018-12-01  | 986      |
| 2019-01-01  | 966      |
| 2019-02-01  | 1072     |
| 2019-03-01  | 1078     |
| 2019-04-01  | 1035     |
| 2019-05-01  | 827      |
| 2019-06-01  | 804      |
| 2019-07-01  | 836      |
| 2019-08-01  | 1062     |

**Q3.  What do you think we should do with these null values in the fresh_segments.interest_metrics**
```sql
SELECT 
 (SUM(CASE WHEN interest_id IS NULL THEN 1 END)*100  /
    COUNT(*)) AS null_pct
FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics;

DELETE FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics
WHERE interest_id IS NULL;

SELECT 
 (SUM(CASE WHEN interest_id IS NULL THEN 1 END)*100  /
    COUNT(*)) AS null_pct
FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics;
```

**Q4. How many interest_id values exist in the fresh_segments.interest_metrics table but not in the fresh_segments.interest_map table? What about the other way around?**
```SQL
with temp_cte as(
select a.*,b.* 
from fresh_segments.interest_metrics a
FULL OUTER JOIN fresh_segments.interest_map b
on a.interest_id = b.id)

select count(*) from temp_cte where id is NULL;
```

**Q5. Summarise the id values in the fresh_segments.interest_map by its total record count in this table**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM fresh_segments.interest_map
```

**Result:**

| count(*) |
|----------|
| 1209     |


**Q6. What sort of table join should we perform for our analysis and why? Check your logic by checking the rows where interest_id = 21246 in your joined output and include all columns from fresh_segments.interest_metrics and all columns from fresh_segments.interest_map except from the id column.**
```sql
select a.*,b.*
from fresh_segments.interest_metrics a
inner join fresh_segments.interest_map b
on a.interest_id = b.id
where a.interest_id = 21246
and a.month_year2 is not NULL;
```

**Result:**

| _month | _year | month_year | interest_id | composition | index_value | ranking | percentile_ranking | month_year2 | id    | interest_name                    | interest_summary                                      | created_at          | last_modified       |

**Q6. Are there any records in your joined table where the month_year value is before the created_at value from the fresh_segments.interest_map table? Do you think these values are valid and why?**
```sql
select a.*,b.*
from fresh_segments.interest_metrics a
inner join fresh_segments.interest_map b
on a.interest_id = b.id
where a.month_year2 < b.created_at
and a.month_year2 is not NULL;
```

**Result:**

> Yes since we started our date with 01 of every MONTH

**Q2. Using this same total_months measure - calculate the cumulative percentage of all records starting at 14 months - which total_months value passes the 90% cumulative percentage value?**
```sql
with temp_Cte as(
    select interest_id, count(distinct month_year) as total_months
    from fresh_segments.interest_metrics
    where month_year2 is not Null
    group by interest_id
),
temp_cte2 as (
    select total_months,
    count(distinct interest_id) as total_interests
    from temp_cte 
    group by total_months
    order by total_months desc
)

select total_months,
total_interests,
sum(total_interests) over( order by total_months desc) / sum(total_interests) over() *100 cum_perc
from temp_Cte2;
```

**Result:**

| total_months | total_interests | cum_perc |
|--------------|-----------------|----------|
| 14           | 480             | 43.9560  |
| 13           | 82              | 51.4652  |
| 12           | 65              | 57.4176  |
| 11           | 94              | 66.0256  |
| 10           | 86              | 73.9011  |
| 9            | 95              | 82.6007  |
| 8            | 67              | 88.7363  |
| 7            | 90              | 96.9780  |
| 6            | 33              | 100.0000 |



**Q3. If we were to remove all interest_id values which are lower than the total_months value we found in the previous question - how many total data points would we be removing?**
```sql
with temp_Cte as(
    select interest_id, count(distinct month_year) as total_months
    from fresh_segments.interest_metrics
    where month_year2 is not Null
    group by interest_id
)
select count(distinct interest_id) as total_interests
    from temp_cte 
    where total_months < 6;
```



**Q4. Does this decision make sense to remove these data points from a business perspective? Use an example where there are all 14 months present to a removed interest example for your arguments - think about what it means to have less months present from a segment perspective.**
```sql
with temp_Cte as(
    select interest_id, count(distinct month_year) as total_months
    from fresh_segments.interest_metrics
    where month_year2 is not Null
    group by interest_id
),
temp_cte2 as(
select interest_id
    from temp_cte 
    where total_months < 6)

DELETE FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics WHERE interest_id in
(select interest_id from temp_cte2);
```



**Q5. After removing these interests - how many unique interests are there for each month?**
```sql
select month_year, count(distinct interest_id) as interest_id
from fresh_segments.interest_metrics
group by month_year;
```

**Result:**
| month_year | interest_id |
|------------|-------------|
| null       | 1           |
| 01-2019    | 966         |
| 02-2019    | 1072        |
| 03-2019    | 1078        |
| 04-2019    | 1035        |
| 05-2019    | 827         |

| 08-2018    | 752         |
| 08-2019    | 1062        |
| 09-2018    | 774         |
| 10-2018    | 853         |
| 11-2018    | 925         |

**Q1. Using our filtered dataset by removing the interests with less than 6 months worth of data, which are the top 10 and bottom 10 interests which have the largest composition values in any month_year? Only use the maximum composition value for each interest but you must keep the corresponding month_year**

```sql
with temp_cte as (
    select interest_id, month_year, max(composition) as composition
    from fresh_segments.interest_metrics
    group by interest_id, month_year
    order by composition
),
temp_cte2 as(
select * 
from temp_cte order by composition desc limit 10),
temp_cte3 as(
select *
from temp_cte order by composition limit 10
)

select * from temp_cte2
union 
select * from temp_cte3;
```

**Result:**

**Q2. For all of these top 10 interests which interest appears the most often?**

```SQL
with temp_cte as (
    select month_year, interest_id, round(composition/index_value,2) as avg_comp
    from fresh_segments.interest_metrics
    where month_year is not Null
),
temp_cte2 as (
    select month_year, interest_id,
    avg_comp,
    row_number() over(partition by month_year order by avg_comp desc) ranking
    from temp_cte
)
select interest_id, count(*) as total_interest
from temp_cte2 where ranking <=10
group by interest_id
order by total_interest DESC
limit 1;
```

**Result:**

| interest_id | total_interest |
|-------------|----------------|
| 6065        | 10             |


**Q3. What is the average of the average composition for the top 10 interests for each month?**

```SQL
with temp_cte as (
    select month_year, interest_id, round(composition/index_value,2) as avg_comp
    from fresh_segments.interest_metrics
    where month_year is not Null
),
temp_cte2 as (
    select month_year, interest_id,
    avg_comp,
    row_number() over(partition by month_year order by avg_comp desc) ranking
    from temp_cte
)
select month_year, round(avg(avg_comp),2) as avg_comp
from temp_cte2 where ranking <=10
group by month_year
;
```

**Result:**

| month_year | avg_comp |
|------------|----------|
| 01-2019    | 6.4      |
| 02-2019    | 6.58     |
