## üõ†Ô∏è Problem Statement

> Danny was scrolling through his Instagram feed when something really caught his eye - ‚Äú80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!‚Äù
> 
> Danny was sold on the idea, but he knew that pizza alone was not going to help him get seed funding to expand his new Pizza Empire - so he had one more genius idea to combine with it - he was going to Uberize it - and so **Pizza Runner** was launched!
> 
> Danny started by recruiting ‚Äúrunners‚Äù to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny‚Äôs house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.

### **```runner_orders```**

<details>
<summary>
View table
</summary>

After each orders are received through the system - they are assigned to a runner - however not all orders are fully completed and can be cancelled by the restaurant or the customer.

The **```pickup_time```** is the timestamp at which the runner arrives at the Pizza Runner headquarters to pick up the freshly cooked pizzas. 

The **```distance```** and **```duration```** fields are related to how far and long the runner had to travel to deliver the order to the respective customer.

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Data Preprocessing

### **Data Issues**

Data issues in the existing schema include:

* **```customer_orders``` table**
  - ```null``` values entered as text
  - using both ```NaN``` and ```null``` values
* **```runner_orders``` table**
  - ```null``` values entered as text
  - using both ```NaN``` and ```null``` values
  - units manually entered in ```distance``` and ```duration``` columns

### **Data Cleaning**

**```customer_orders```**
- Converting ```null``` and ```NaN``` values into blanks ```''``` in ```exclusions``` and ```extras```
  - Blanks indicate that the customer requested no extras/exclusions for the pizza, whereas ```null``` values would be ambiguous.
- Saving the transformations in a temporary table
  - We want to avoid permanently changing the raw data via ```UPDATE``` commands if possible.

**```runner_orders```**

- Converting ```'null'``` text values into null values for ```pickup_time```, ```distance``` and ```duration```
- Extracting only numbers and decimal spaces for the distance and duration columns
  - Use regular expressions and ```NULLIF``` to convert non-numeric entries to null values
- Converting blanks, ```'null'``` and ```NaN``` into null values for cancellation
- Saving the transformations in a temporary table

**Result:**

### **Q5. What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?**
```SQL
with temp as (
    select min(duration) as shortest,
        max(duration) as longest
        from pizza_runner.runner_orders_cleaned
        where cancellation is Null
)

select (longest-shortest) as diff from temp;
```

| diff |
|------|
| 30   |

### **Q6. What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?**
```SQL
select runner_id, order_id, round(avg(distance*60/duration),2) as avg_speed, distance
from pizza_runner.runner_orders_cleaned
where cancellation is Null
group by runner_id, order_id
order by runner_id, order_id;
```

| runner_id | order_id | avg_speed | distance |
|-----------|----------|-----------|----------|
| 1         | 1        | 37.5      | 20.00    |
| 1         | 2        | 44.44     | 20.00    |
| 1         | 3        | 39        | 13.00    |
| 1         | 10       | 60        | 10.00    |
| 2         | 4        | 34.5      | 23.00    |
| 2         | 7        | 60        | 25.00    |
| 2         | 8        | 92        | 23.00    |
| 3         | 5        | 40        | 10.00    |

**Finding:**
> *Speed is in increasing order for order_id but data is too low for any conclusion*  

### **Q7. What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?**
```sql
select runner_id,
(sum(case when cancellation is Null then 1 else 0 end)*100/count(order_id)) as succesful_delivery_per
from pizza_runner.runner_orders_cleaned
group by runner_id;
```

| runner_id | succesful_delivery_per |
|-----------|------------------------|
| 1         | 100.0000               |
| 2         | 75.0000                |
| 3         | 50.0000                |
